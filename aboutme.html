<h1> Books.Politics. Food</h1>
<p> Hi, my name is Takia Mohinuddin. I am 17 years old and my zodiac sign is an aries. 
    I am the youngest out of 4 girls and I live in a mainly female domainated household, 
    so it is a given that I am a feminist. I am also a huge foodie. I love sleeping and reading.
    I despise only two things tomatoes and snakes. If you have either one of those things, don't even come near me.
    Fun fact: I read way too much </p>
