    <p>     Hi, my name is Takia Mohinuddin. I am 17 years old and my zodiac sign is an aries. 
    I am the youngest out of 4 girls and I live in a mainly female domainated household, 
    so it is a given that I am a feminist. I am also a huge foodie. I love sleeping and reading.
    I despise only two things tomatoes and snakes. If you have either one of those things, don't 
    even come near me.Fun fact: I read way too much. My favorite webpages are: https://www.netflix.com/
    ,www.fanfiction.net, https://www.goodreads.com/genres/young-adult, https://www.bklynlibrary.org/, 
     and https://www.barnesandnoble.com. I am a cat person, which kind of suits me because I am an introvert. 
    If you ever see me reading a book it will be deeply appricated for you to leave me alone in my books unless
    its a life and death situation then you have full on permission to bother me. I am also very picky on what I 
    read, for example I hated the hunger games and the divegrent series but I loved The Mortal Instrument series 
    and if you do not know what that is then something is really wrong with you. </p>
