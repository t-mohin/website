    <p>Hi, my name is Takia Mohinuddin. I am an Aries. I am the youngest out of 4 girls and I live in a mainly female-dominated household. My favorite foods are grilled cheese, pizza, and sushi. My favorite colors are blue, white, light lavender, and olive green. I am a mixture of both Ravenclaw and Slytherin. I am afraid of snakes and heights. I love wolves and cats. I love rainy days and starry nights. I enjoy having long conversations with a cup of tea. </p>
  
   <p>I am a college student with a couple of good coding skills. I am no extraordinary person. All I am is a simple person. </p>
   
 <p> But I have this passion to be beyond just someone normal. I want to open up opportunities for women, who have spent their entire life being forced down. I want to be able to teach society that being a women does not mean that we were not enough. We come from a society where being a women means being a caregiver, not a leader. I want to help change that idea.
 </p>
